# I Hit Burnout This Week And Here’s What Happened

In this candid and personal video, Chris, a platform engineer experienced in cloud and Kubernetes, shares his recent experience with burnout. Despite his passion and drive to learn and do more, he hit a wall of fatigue and unproductiveness that many in the tech industry can relate to. Chris delves into what led to his burnout, how it affected him, and the strategies he plans to implement to manage his productivity and mental health moving forward.

## Understanding Burnout in Tech
Burnout isn’t uncommon in the fast-paced tech world. Chris expresses how juggling the demands of a new job, continuous learning, and personal projects can quickly lead to fatigue. He honestly describes a week where he accomplished nothing productive and instead resorted to watching anime in a bath for hours. This honest admission highlights the intensity of burnout symptoms.

## The Pressure to Keep Up
Working in cloud and tech requires constant learning to stay current. New technologies emerge rapidly, and professionals often look to platforms like LinkedIn to gauge industry trends and progress. However, this can fuel feelings of inadequacy or imposter syndrome, as others seem to accomplish much more, faster. Chris discusses the challenge of measuring up to these often unspoken expectations and the toll it takes on morale.

## Shifting from Quantity to Quality
Chris shares his realization about aiming for quality over quantity in his work and study routines. He highlights the tendency to dive deeply into tasks, sometimes spending hours trying to solve issues late into the night, which contributes to exhaustion. To combat this, he plans to implement a structured calendar-focused approach to break the day into concentrated focus sessions followed by lighter tasks, and strategies to improve sleep and mental shutdown at night.

## Balancing Work, Family, and Personal Growth
The challenge is compounded by family responsibilities, which limit the time available for study and projects. Chris reflects on how his life with children shapes his time management and ambitions, acknowledging the unpredictability and sacrifices involved but also the motivations to keep pushing forward.

## Takeaways
- Burnout is a real and common challenge in tech careers, especially with the pressure to constantly learn and perform.
- Comparing yourself to others on social media can deepen imposter syndrome and diminish confidence.
- Quality-focused work sessions can help prevent burnout and improve productivity.
- Structured scheduling and boundaries around work and study time can support better focus and mental health.
- Balancing family life and professional growth requires realistic expectations and self-compassion.

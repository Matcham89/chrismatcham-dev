# Cloud Engineer Reveals Top Job Hunting Strategies

In this video, Chris, a platform engineer with 5 years of experience in cloud and Kubernetes, shares his insights on how he approaches job hunting in the evolving cloud engineering landscape. He discusses how job titles and roles have expanded, the importance of focusing on skills rather than titles, and his method for searching job listings effectively.

## The Changing Landscape of Cloud Engineering Jobs

Chris explains that five years ago, job roles in cloud engineering were more straightforward — usually cloud engineer or solutions architect. Now, the space is crowded with roles like DevOps, SRE, AI/ML Ops, DevSecOps, platform engineer, and more. Because job titles and role definitions can be subjective and vary between companies and recruiters, Chris emphasizes the importance of focusing on the skills and tools required rather than the job titles themselves.

## Keyword-Based Job Searching

Instead of searching for specific job titles, Chris searches using key skills and technologies, such as Kubernetes and Terraform. For example, he explains searching for "Kubernetes" can surface a variety of roles that use that technology, offering a broader range of job opportunities. He highlights that many roles, despite different titles, require knowledge of Kubernetes, cloud platforms, infrastructure as code, and related tools.

## Reviewing Job Descriptions and Skills Fit

Chris reviews job descriptions he encounters during his search, focusing on whether he can match the required technologies and skills. He notes that even if some requirements like specific cloud platforms (e.g., Azure) are unfamiliar, as long as the key tools align with his skills, the job could still be a good fit. He also emphasizes the importance of cultural fit aspects like problem-solving attitude and collaboration. Some jobs may have vague or broad descriptions, but focusing on key technologies and responsibilities helps Chris decide if he should apply.

## Navigating New and Emerging Roles

Chris discusses unfamiliar job titles like "Live Ops" or roles supporting Gen AI products, acknowledging that some roles are new or niche. Even with limited direct experience, he encourages applying if core skills overlap, while also noting the importance of staying current with industry advancements. He points out that job descriptions in emerging fields may contain buzzwords but still relate to infrastructure, monitoring, and platform enhancement familiar to cloud engineers.

## Practical Advice for Job Hunters

- Ignore strict job title definitions; focus on required skills and technologies.
- Use keywords related to your core competencies in job searches instead of specific titles.
- Pay attention to the technologies and tools listed, not just titles; many roles require overlapping skills.
- Don't be deterred by new or unfamiliar job titles — research and apply if the skills match.
- Stay up to date with emerging technologies and continuously improve your skill set to remain competitive.

Chris's approach is practical and adaptable, encouraging job hunters to be flexible and skill-focused, which can help navigate the complex job market in the cloud engineering domain.

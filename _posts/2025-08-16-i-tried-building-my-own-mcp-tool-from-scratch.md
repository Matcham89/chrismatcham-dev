# I Tried Building My Own MCP Tool From Scratch!

If you're a tech engineer or a developer interested in Kubernetes and building MCP (Multi-Cloud Platform) tools, this post walks you through an inspiring journey of creating a personal MCP tool from scratch. Even if you're not a pro programmer, this example shows how you can leverage existing tools and APIs to build something valuable quickly, plus some reflections on why MCP tools matter beyond just scripting.

## What is an MCP Tool and Why Build One?

MCP stands for Multi-Cloud Platform, which often involves using Kubernetes-native solutions to standardize and simplify interactions between different cloud-native components. A Kubernetes-native agentic solution like K agents offers tools to build MCPs easily without slogging through complex standards yourself.

This creator used K agents to explore MCP tooling, especially their new MCP toolkit that lets you define what you want your MCP tool to do and then generates the infrastructure around it automatically. This lets you focus strictly on the tools business logic instead of plumbing.

The takeaway? MCP tools standardize how cloud-native tools interact, making it easier to integrate with IDEs like VS Code or Studio and facilitating powerful workflows with less manual configuration.

## Building a YouTube-to-Blog Scraper MCP Tool

The creator identified a personal problem: creating video content is time-consuming, and there's less time left for blogging about videos. They wanted to automate this by building a tool that would scrape YouTube videos transcript data and convert it into blog posts.

- They defined a simple MCP tool called "YouTube" within the K agents framework.
- The MCP grabbed YouTube video metadata and transcripts through the YouTube API.
- Because many videos have auto-generated transcripts cluttered with filler words and pauses, the tool was designed to clean and proof the output for readability.
- The backend tool is a Python script auto-generated mostly with the help of ChatGPT.
- A Google Cloud project was created to get an API key for accessing YouTube metadata and transcripts.
- The whole setup was done locally without requiring Kubernetes, making it accessible to beginners.

This showcases how you dont need to be an expert programmer to leverage cloud-native tooling. You can focus on your logic and let the MCP framework handle integration complexities.

## The MCP Inspector Tool: Quick Feedback Loop

An included CLI tool called the MCP Inspector lets you run and test your MCP tools interactively before deploying them. Here are some highlights:

- After launching, it discovered available MCP tools: a built-in Echo tool and the custom YouTube tool.
- The YouTube tool takes a video ID or URL and returns clean transcript data, metadata, and video info.
- Running the tool locally showed quick, accurate resultslike pulling video ID, title, description, and cleaned transcripts.

This interactive inspector workflow creates a solid development feedback loop, helping you adjust and improve your MCP tool rapidly.

## Benefits of MCP Tools Over Plain Scripts

Why not just write a simple Python script? The creator probed this question and offered insightful thoughts:

- MCP tools provide a standardized interface and environment for your tool that can plug into any supporting client, IDE, or orchestration platform.
- You avoid tangled configurations; the MCP ecosystem handles API wiring, authentication patterns, service discovery, and multi-agent communication protocols.
- This modularity means others can adopt your MCP tool on their systems seamlessly.
- Development and deployment workflows become easier with Kubernetes-native primitives and can leverage agent-to-agent interactions.
- As a portfolio project, an MCP tool is impressiveit hits key buzzwords like Kubernetes, AI/LLM, and microservice agents, which are trendy and valuable skills.

So yes, its more than just code. Its about adopting modern cloud-native architectural patterns for scalability and reuse.

## Next Steps and Vision

The creator plans to:

- Add authentication to secure the MCP tool.
- Enable agent gateway and agent-to-agent communication supported by the MCP framework.
- Automate blog post creation by integrating the scraper with GitHub Pages and using further MCP tools to clean and submit pull requests for blog posts.
- Keep refining the tool for more usability.

This is an excellent example of prototyping an AI/automation-driven workflow and appreciating the modular power of MCP tools in the modern developer ecosystem.

## Takeaways

- MCP tools simplify building cloud-native integrations by automating infrastructure specs around your tool logic.
- You dont need deep programming skills to build useful MCP tools; frameworks and AI assistants (like ChatGPT) can help a lot.
- Interactive tools like the MCP Inspector help speed up development and testing cycles.
- MCP tools enable standardized, portable, and scalable cloud-native microservices, outperforming standalone scripts.
- Using MCP tools is a great skill to showcase in portfolios, catching attention with buzzwords like Kubernetes and AI/LLM integration.

If you're interested in learning or building your own MCP tool or want a walkthrough tutorial, definitely consider exploring K agents and their MCP toolkit.

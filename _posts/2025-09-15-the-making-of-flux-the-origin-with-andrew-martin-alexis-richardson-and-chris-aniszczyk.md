# The Making of Flux: The Origin, with Andrew Martin, Alexis Richardson, and Chris Aniszczyk | KubeFM

This video explores the origin, journey, and impact of Flux, a prominent open-source project in the cloud-native infrastructure space. Initially created by Weaveworks, Flux emerged to simplify container management and became a core tool for GitOps by treating git as the single source of truth for deployment configurations.

## The Beginning of Flux

Flux started as a tool to manage Kubernetes and containers more effectively. Weaveworks founders saw the need for better developer and operational tooling around containers, leading to innovations like WeaveNet for networking and Weave Scope for visualization. Flux originated as a solution to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters automatically, emphasizing a "declarative pull-based" approach that uses Git as a source of truth, ensuring safe, consistent, and observable deployments.

## Hardening Flux and CNCF Graduation

Growing from hackday code to a CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) graduated project involved demonstrating stability, security, and a broad collaborative community governance model. Chris Aniszczyk of the CNCF details Fluxs completion of audits and steps to graduation in late 2022, a rare milestone achieved by only about 10% of CNCF projects, signifying technical maturity and ecosystem adoption.

## Flux in Regulated and Enterprise Environments

Fluxs pull-based deployment model appeals strongly to regulated industries like banking because it ensures safer compliance practices. Alexis Richardson highlights how GitOps principles provide transparency and control, although enterprise users often layer on additional workflows and approvals through GUIs and tooling to meet their compliance needs.

## Flux's Transition and Future Sustainability

When Weaveworks faced financial difficulties, Control Plane stepped in to support Fluxs sustainability. Control Plane CEO Andrew Martin explains their commitment to maintaining Fluxs core as a secure, reliable open-source project, while developing enterprise-grade offerings for highly regulated environments. With CNCF acting as a mediator, Control Plane rapidly hired key maintainers to ensure the projects stability.

## The Road Ahead

Fluxs roadmap involves three key workstreams: continuing upstream development with community engagement, enhancing Flux with an operator for large scale deployments and advanced security, and growing Control Plane's enterprise support offerings. This approach ensures Flux stays innovative yet reliable, meeting both community and enterprise needs.

### Takeaways

- Flux began as an operational tool to simplify container and Kubernetes deployment using GitOps principles.
- Achieving CNCF graduation marked Fluxs maturity in security, stability, and multi-company governance.
- Regulated industries favor Fluxs declarative, pull-based deployment for compliance and control.
- Financial challenges at Weaveworks threatened Flux but Control Planes intervention ensured sustainability.
- Future Flux development balances upstream open-source innovation with enterprise-grade support and enhancements.
